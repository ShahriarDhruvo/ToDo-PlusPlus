                        As-salamu alaykum, I am Shahriar Elahi Dhruvo. I am
                        studying Software Engineering (SWE) at Shahjalal
                        University of Science & Technology (SUST). I wanted to
                        learn React JS & Django for better or for worse. After
                        learning that, I was thinking for some ideas for a
                        website to practice some skills in that department. I
                        built a Todo list in react & django to learn this
                        DRF(Django Rest Framework). Then I thought, everytime
                        people think of something to do (got some ideas) and
                        think, they will implement it whenever they got chance
                        but after some time they forget about it. This is no
                        exception for me too. So I started taking notes in my
                        Todo list website that I built. Soon, I realize this has
                        some limitation and I also don't like this design. So I
                        wanted to redesign it and implement some feature that I
                        need. So here we go. This is the project that I built
                        for fun. I built this one by keeping in mind that I will
                        use it. I know there is a lot of this kind of project
                        done by some big companies like google's "Google Keep" &
                        bunch of other note taking app. But mine is not a note
                        taking website. And I am aware of that there are a lot
                        of website or mobile app that do the same but I wanted
                        to make my own üòÅ. And this kind of website makes more
                        sense for a mobile app but sadly, now I only know how to
                        develop a complete website (somewhat üòÇ). So, If you
                        like what I did then like, share and give star to my
                        github repo. Hope you all are doing well in this tough
                        situation. These are some people's without whom this was
                        not possible: My friends: R.M. Muksid Uddin, Farhan
                        Dipto, Shakirul Hasan Khan. Seniors: Rafiul Islam, Dipto
                        Mondal, Ali Ahmmed Tonoy and of course my family
                        members. I know this is not a big deal but it doesn't
                        hurt to write about it, is it? (EI LINE TA UPORE
                        THAKBE). After 3 months of procrastination I finally
                        completed this project. This is not much but I gave my
                        best for as little time as I had and as little patience
                        I have.(oh yeah idea,full 100% code shob amr kora baki
